### About

[View project](https://cahe1540.github.io/leaderboard_AOE2-DE/)

### Description

This project is a working leaderboard for a game I enjoy to play called Age of Empires II: DE. I followed the model view controller architecture to build it. When this site is visited, or index.html is opened on the browser, a fetch call is sent to the aoe2.net api for the ranked 1v1 leader boaord. A circular loading animation should display while the command is completed and the leaderboard is rendered to the UI. At the top of the page there are buttons. The current leaderboard button should be highlighted. When a different leaderboard button is pressed, then that data for the new leaderboard is fetched and the pressed button becomes highlighted. Any name can be pressed on the leaderboard table and that player's match history(10 games) will pop up on a modal. There is a simple search feature that allows any active player to be looked up. When a person is searched, that player's leaderboard information will be shown in isolation on the page.
